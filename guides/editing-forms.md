# Editing Forms

## How to Edit a Published Form

1. Navigate to your form in **Channels > Forms**
2. Click **Edit** in the command bar
3. Make your changes in the form designer
4. Click **Save** to publish changes immediately

### Important Notes on Caching

- Because the form is cached on a CDN, changes may take up to 10 minutes to reflect on the live page
- To see changes immediately for testing, use the Dynamics 365 Form Debugger: https://pattens.tech/dynamics-365-form-debugger

## Creating a Copy

If you prefer not to edit the live form directly:

1. Open the form you want to copy
2. Click **Save As** or **Copy**
3. Make changes to the new version
4. Publish when ready
5. Update your website embed code to use the new form
